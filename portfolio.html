        <p>
          I am currently a member of the TAMU ThinkTank website development team. This is a year-long challenge to overhaul and modernize the front-end and back-end of the organization's website.
          During the Fall 2024 semester, we were tasked with expanding the single-page website to have multiple pages and a more responsive design using TSX and Tailwind CSS. 
          I was primarily tasked with working on the "About" page of the new website as well as minor changes on the main page. I am currently working on updating member applications using Prisma.

        <p>
          As a member of the <a href = "https://www.aggiecodingclub.com/"><i>Aggie Coding Club</i></a>, I am member of the team developing the Starting from the STEM website.
          This is a full-stack TSX Node.js web application intended to help students learn and hone their skills in college engineering core courses such as Calculus and Physics.
          During the Fall 2024 semester, I was tasked with integrating OpenAI's GPT-3.5 API in order to facilitate learning through the Feynman Technique.
          Currently, I am working on incorporating the chatbot into the front end using props to allow students to choose specific topics they would like to learn.

        <p>
          During the Fall 2024 semester, I worked on a team to develop an autonomous vehicle simulation using the <a href = "https://carla.org/"><i>CARLA</i></a> simulator as a member of the <a href = "https://www.aggiedatascience.com/"><i>Aggie Data Science Club</i></a>.
          I was a member of the automobile functionality team, where I developed Python scripts to control elements of the simulation and gather raw sensor data simulating a real driving environment.
          In addition, I aided in the design and development of an F1 car model with sensors to be tested in the simulations.

          As a member of the <a href = "https://www.hkntamu.com/"><i>Eta Kappa Nu (HKN)</i></a> chapter at Texas A&M University, I participated in the HKN project team where we developed an analog theremin.
          We used a schematic to create the physical circuit using only analog components, capable of altering pitch and volume based on the user's hand proximity to the antenna sensors.
