    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Howdy! My name is Jeremy Tran, and I am the loudest and proudest member of the Fightin' Texas Aggie class of 2026! I am currently a third-year student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering with minors in Cybersecurity and Mathematics. 
      I'm passionate in learning about hardware and software integration, especially in the fields of cybersecurity and networking, and I hope to continue to graduate studies in these fields after obtaining my bachelor degree.
      <br>
      <br>
      Outside of class, my main passion is music. I am a euphonium player in the Texas A&M Wind Symphony, with whom I had the opportunity to tour with in Spain for 10 days, playing in 3 concerts.
